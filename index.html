         The combine experience I have working at the top FOrtune 500 companies has allowed me to develope a skill set that help me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business. 
       </p>
       <p>
         I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.

         As a developer, you can have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.
       </p>
       <p>
         A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean. 
       </p>
       <p>
         "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer. It's time to evaluate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate about
